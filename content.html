            Dear Moms, <br>
Your wisdom and kindness are like the roots of a mighty oak tree, anchoring us in love and nurturing our growth. Just as the oak's branches reach toward the sky, your lessons guide us toward the light.

Through life's storms, you've been our lighthouses, casting beams of hope and resilience. Your sacrifices, like the hidden roots beneath the soil, sustain us even when we can't see them.

To the unsung heroes who weave the fabric of our lives: Your laughter is the melody that echoes in our hearts, and your love is the compass that points us home.

Though some of you have become constellations in the night sky, your legacy continues to shineâ€”a celestial map of kindness, strength, and grace.

<br> <span class="move_down">Happy Mother's Day!</span>
